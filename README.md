# Task-5 : Decision Trees and Random Forests
This task demonstrates the application of **Decision Trees** and **Random Forest** for classification. It covers model training, overfitting analysis, ensemble accuracy, and feature importance visualizations.

## Dataset
- Using Heart Disease Dataset
- (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

## Features
- Train a Decision Tree classifier and visualize the tree.
- Compares single-tree accuracy with a Random Forest Ensemble.
- Ranks features by importance.
- Evaluates models via cross-validation.
